Created a video game single page application that allowed users to search for their favorite video games and add comments to games they've played.  We had to use mapping to connect each of our entities thus allowing the user to find their video games which were tied to each of their various consoles.  We had our api connected to our front-end via JavaScript.  We styled our website using CSS.  We drove out the creation of our product using TDD.
